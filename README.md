# Financial Transactions Analysis

This repository contains tools and scripts for analyzing financial transaction data. It includes functionalities to import CSV data into PostgreSQL, perform data cleaning, and conduct various types of analysis on transaction data. The goal is to provide insights into transaction patterns, detect anomalies, and generate meaningful reports for financial decision-making.

## Features

- Import financial transactions from CSV to PostgreSQL
- Data cleaning and preprocessing scripts
- SQL queries for transaction data analysis
- Visualization of transaction trends
- Anomaly detection in financial transactions
- Comprehensive documentation and examples

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle: [Financial Transactions Dataset for Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mdhossanr/financial-transactions-dataset-for-analysis/data).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- PostgreSQL
- Python (optional, for advanced analysis)
- pgAdmin (optional, for database management)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/financial-transactions-analysis.git
    cd financial-transactions-analysis
    ```

2. **Set up your PostgreSQL database**

    Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running on your machine. Create a new database for the project.

    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE financial_transactions;
    ```

3. **Download the dataset from Kaggle**

    Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mdhossanr/financial-transactions-dataset-for-analysis/data) and place the CSV file in the `data/` directory of this repository.

4. **Import the dataset into PostgreSQL**

    Use the provided script to import the CSV data into your PostgreSQL database. Adjust the script to match the path to your CSV file.

    ```sql
    COPY transactions(TransactionID, AccountID, Timestamp, TransactionType, TransactionAmount, AccountBalance)
    FROM '/path/to/your/transactions.csv'
    DELIMITER ','
    CSV HEADER;
    ```

### Usage

Run the provided SQL scripts and Python scripts (if applicable) to perform data analysis. Refer to the documentation for specific instructions on each script.

### Examples

#### SQL Query Example

To get the count of transactions by type, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT TransactionType, COUNT(*) AS TransactionCount
FROM transactions
GROUP BY TransactionType;
